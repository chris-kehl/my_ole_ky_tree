## Welcome My Ole Kentucky Tree App
# A deeplearning application that detects native Ky trees with the fastai library


## This project is built using the fastai library to run a deeplearning model that predicts native trees of Kentucky.
* The trained deepleaning model can be found at the following git hub repository https://github.com/chris-kehl/Kentucky_Tree_classifier.
* I used Google Colab to create the machine learning models to take advantage of the GPU's and the convience of cloud computing,
